If EC2 pem file is lost then we can't use ec2, we have to terminate it.
If user cli credentials lost then we can create new security credentials
	First we have to mark previous credentials inactive then delete it.
	Then create new security credentials and use it for connecting user in cli to aws
Linux ec2 require 4 gb for in installation, so 8 gb is enough
Windows will take 30 gb for in installation
For checking 32 or 64 bit machine on windows : system information -> 64 bit 
For enabling internet on ec2 windows maching : server manager -> local server -> Disable IE Enhanced security configuration
